# Movie-recommendation-system-main
About This project is a movie recommendation system that uses collaborative filtering to suggest personalized movie recommendations. It consists of two parts: a machine learning model that processes and trains on user data, and an interactive user interface where users input a movie title to receive 10 recommended films based on their preferences.
